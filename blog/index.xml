      <description>HUGO has large collection of Themes, though every themes has unique look and feel to it, some are easier to work with but has limited set of features and others are having good array of features but are difficult to work with.
I have tried almost 10-15 themes before selecting the theme I am currently using for this blog at the time of writing this article. I very much like the look and feel of this theme but it lacks some functionality like HTML Injection into a post (or may be I am yet to learn it) but I can live with it for now.</description>

      <description>Well the answer is quiet simple actually, Googling every possible combination of the keywords you are Googling right now. After endless hours of research and trying out many different options I have a solution which works for works for me and that too for free if you don&amp;rsquo;t need a custom domain, with only one Disclaimer it only works for static webpages.
So, if you are looking for creating a static website you can this post is going to help you otherwise it is a good read.</description>
